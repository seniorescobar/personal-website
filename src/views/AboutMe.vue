              Iâ€™m a 23 year old web developer from Slovenia, working mostly with
              the Go Programming Language, which I have adored ever since
              finding out about it a few years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              Among other platforms I find immensely interesting, is AWS which I
              was increasingly exposed to working in companies building highly
              performant and scalable software.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recently I have also started getting a feel of front-end
              development, using the Vue.js framework, but have only used it for
              my personal projects.
