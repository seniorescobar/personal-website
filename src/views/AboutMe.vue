                Iâ€™m a 23 year old web developer from Slovenia, working mostly
                with the Go Programming Language, which I have adored ever since
                finding out about it a few years ago.

                Among other platforms I find immensely interesting, is AWS which
                I was increasingly exposed to working in companies building
                highly performant and scalable software.

                Recently I have also started getting a feel of front-end
                development, using the Vue.js framework, but have only used it
                for my personal projects.
