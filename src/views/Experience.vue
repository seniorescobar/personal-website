            Landing my first part time job in tech at just 16 years old, I
            couldn’t be happier to work in a dev team of 20 people, working on
            non-critical tasks that required knowledge of HTML, CSS, PHP and
            PostgreSQL. Towards the end I also got introduced to Golang, and
            have since stuck with it.

            At Zemanta, an Outbrain company, I found it interesting and very
            challenging working on a Golang back-end for a real-time bidding
            platform for web ads, having learned a lot about building highly
            performant and scalable software. I’ve also become familiar with AWS
            services and learned how they are used in production.

            After taking some time off to fully focus on my uni studies, I
            joined Viberate, a fast growing startup in the music industry, where
            I worked 4 days per week on a Golang back-end, used for a festivals
            mobile app. Despite enjoying much more responsibility, I ended up
            leaving after just 4 months, not being fully satisfied with the work
            environment.

            My next career goal was moving to Germany, accepting an offer from
            AppLike, to work on a Golang back-end for a platform focused on
            optimizing the process of acquiring users for company’s mobile
            games. Among a sea of AWS services I used there, I also came across
            Terraform used for managing them. Despite loving to work with the
            team and the tech stack, I found it difficult settling in, being so
            far away from my home country. Since there was no option to work
            remotely, I found no other solution but to move back home and wait
            for an opportunity that would allow me to continue something
            similar, but from home.
